# Symball Docker Images

For both production and development use, this repository is a collection of Docker build files based on Alpine Linux for supporting a combination of PHP environments. The Developer images aim to add a set of tools such as static code analysis and task runners so that a developers machine can be kept clean. For an example of how these images can be used in a project to serve a variety of needs, please see the [Docker Quick Stack](https://github.com/symball/docker-quick-stack) project.
